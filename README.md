# INT-1.3 and INT-2.3 Spring Intensive

## Course Description

Intensive courses are hands on, immersive experiences designed to give students time to apply their skills to building original products (website or apps) and practice software engineering skills. The course is a week of coding all day with daily check ins and feedback from instructors on progress, short instructional session on key concepts, and ongoing support from instructors and classmates. In Spring Intensive 1 the focus is on user testing, shipping products as well best practices and steps to build and pitch an original product in a week. The Intensive culminates with a Demo Night in which each student pitches their product to their classmates, industry professionals and recruiters.

**INT 1.3 Spring Intensive 1** is for Juniors while **INT 2.3 Spring Intensive 2** is for Seniors. Students will work on similar skills with different evaluation criteria and expectations.

### Projects

- [Spring Intensive Project](Assignments/Project-Requirements.md)

**All projects require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the intensive**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.


## Evaluation
To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Attend all class sessions
- Meet the project requirements using the [SPD Intensive Product Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pdtRdgVISE07fFc8oBi5hCnLkwBQDFG5_3f79aDV1WU/preview)
 - Juniors must score at least a 2.5, Seniors must score at least a 3.
- Present your pitch using the [Pitch Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pdtRdgVISE07fFc8oBi5hCnLkwBQDFG5_3f79aDV1WU/preview)
 - Juniors must score at least a 2.5, Seniors must score at least a 3.

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
