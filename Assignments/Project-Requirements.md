## Project Requirements
Select **one** of these four options for your intensive project:
1. **New project, solo** - start a new project from scratch. Project github repo must be started before March 8th. Evaluation below
2. **New project, team** - start a new project with a team of engineers. Project github repo must be started before March 8th.
3. **Old project, solo** - continue building an old project into an even better version. This can be a project you made in SPD, a previous intensive, or a susbstantial extension on a class project. 
 - To choose this option, **you must fill out [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZh24HKYJlB7uuVZB1C8KNeBNC2VdzD8X87PVHwXpqU/edit#heading=h.gpk1osyprrjo) and get it approved by a staff member by Tuesday at 3pm** in order to choose this option. 
4. **Old project, team** - continue building an old project into an even better version. This can be a project you made in SPD, a previous intensive, or a susbstantial extension on a class project. 
 - To choose this option, **EACH TEAMMATE must fill out [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZh24HKYJlB7uuVZB1C8KNeBNC2VdzD8X87PVHwXpqU/edit#heading=h.gpk1osyprrjo) and get it approved by a staff member by Tuesday at 3pm** in order to choose this option. Each teammate will have an individual portion of the project they are accountable for, instead of having just one deliverable.

Students with <3 portfolio projects should work on a new project. Things that do not count as a portfolio project include: class contractor project, projects with code that is not live and functional.

## Product Submission
Product submission happens during Product Pitches on Monday at 12:00pm, pitches that take place that Monday from 3:00-5:00pm - in small groups, each student will present their product and check in with an instructor or staff member to get approval. Weâ€™ll also send a form to you input your link to your app / code on Github.

### Tips
- **Product idea choice** - The project can be building a product off of your idea from SPD class, or it can be a new product. It cannot simply be a repurposing of a contractor project that was done in a technical course.
- **Scope the project small** - Remember not to over scope your first iteration. It should be a "skateboard" version of your idea, so simple that it barely meets your user need - check out these [class slides on scoping your project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UKVsUOCxQPNT3P42cvsTYxhNl7lpsDHjJew_a5K1JaM/preview?slide=id.p) for reference.  In the future, we'll use this [portfolio project rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nd70y0jzxD31mgxvwxgXxUY_Bi4YAN_kX9To_M0UilI/preview) to evaluate and level-up your shipped products.
- You can help your peers debug their code.
- Your product can be the idea you developed in SPD or a new project. But it has to be started and completed within this week.
