1. **New project, solo** - start a new project from scratch. Project github repo must be started before March 8th. Evaluation below
2. **New project, team** - start a new project with a team of engineers. Project github repo must be started before March 8th.
3. **Old project, solo** - continue building an old project into an even better version. This can be a project you made in SPD, a previous intensive, or a susbstantial extension on a class project. 
      - To choose this option, **you must fill out [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZh24HKYJlB7uuVZB1C8KNeBNC2VdzD8X87PVHwXpqU/edit#heading=h.gpk1osyprrjo) and get it approved by a staff member by Monday 3/18 at 4pm (you've been invited to a class session where you will get approval** in order to choose this option.

      - To choose this option, **EACH TEAMMATE must fill out [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZh24HKYJlB7uuVZB1C8KNeBNC2VdzD8X87PVHwXpqU/edit#heading=h.gpk1osyprrjo) and get it approved by a staff member by Monday 3/18 at 4pm (you've been invited to a class session where you will get approval)** in order to choose this option. Each teammate will have an individual portion of the project they are accountable for, instead of having just one deliverable. Teams cannot be more than 5 engineers.

Proud of
Check early
minimum requirements: 
Examples that meet that we are proud of and here is why - testing, code, features (Examples from each track)

Things that do not count as a portfolio project include: class contractor project, projects with code that is not functional.

## Product Submission
Product submission happens before Product Pitches on Monday. Pitches that take place that Monday from 3:00-5:00pm - in small groups, each student will present their product and check in with an instructor or staff member to get approval. Weâ€™ll also send a form for you to you input your link to your app / code on Github.

### Tips
- **Product idea choice** - The project can be building a product off of your idea from SPD class, or it can be a new product. It cannot simply be a repurposing of a contractor project that was done in a technical course.
- **Finish the product Monday before demo night, debug and polish on Tuesday**
- **Scope the project small** - Remember not to over scope your first iteration. It should be a "skateboard" version of your idea, so simple that it barely meets your user need - check out these [class slides on scoping your project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UKVsUOCxQPNT3P42cvsTYxhNl7lpsDHjJew_a5K1JaM/preview?slide=id.p) for reference.  In the future, we'll use this [portfolio project rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nd70y0jzxD31mgxvwxgXxUY_Bi4YAN_kX9To_M0UilI/preview) to evaluate and level-up your shipped products.
- You can help your peers debug their code.
