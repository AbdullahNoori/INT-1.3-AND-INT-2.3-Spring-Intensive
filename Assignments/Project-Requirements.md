# Spring Intensive Project & Presentation
## Objectives
1. Design, code, and ship your most ambitious portfolio project yet
2. Deliver a high quality product presentation
3. Use resources and staff support to unblock yourself

## Product Requirements
__**FIRST**__ **Product Selection:**

Select **one** of these four options for your intensive project:
1. **New project, solo** - start a new project from scratch. Project github repo must be started after March 8th. Evaluation criteria below.
2. **New project, team** - start a new project with a team of engineers. Project github repo must be started before March 8th. Teams cannot be more than 5 engineers. *EACH TEAMMATE must fill out [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZh24HKYJlB7uuVZB1C8KNeBNC2VdzD8X87PVHwXpqU/edit#heading=h.rwkd8l4c90sq) for their own individual contributions* to the project. You do NOT just make one proposal for the whole team.
3. **Old project, solo** - continue building an old project into an even better version. This can be a project you made in SPD, a previous intensive, or a susbstantial extension on a class project. 
4. **Old project, team** - continue building an old project into an even better version. This can be a project you made in SPD, a previous intensive, or a susbstantial extension on a class project. Teams cannot be more than 5 engineers.

__**SECOND**__ **Proposal approval:**

**All students** must fill out their **individual** intensive proposal (each teammember must fill out a proposal for their own unique contributions) and get it approved by a staff member by Monday 3/18 at 4pm -- you've been invited to a class session at that time where you will get approval.

### Tips
- **Product idea choice** - The project can be building a product off of your idea from SPD class, or it can be a new product. It cannot simply be a repurposing of a contractor project that was done in a technical course.
- **Finish the product Monday before demo night, debug and polish on Tuesday**
- **Scope the project small** - Remember not to over scope your first iteration. It should be a "skateboard" version of your idea, so simple that it barely meets your user need - check out these [class slides on scoping your project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UKVsUOCxQPNT3P42cvsTYxhNl7lpsDHjJew_a5K1JaM/preview?slide=id.p) for reference.  In the future, we'll use this [portfolio project rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nd70y0jzxD31mgxvwxgXxUY_Bi4YAN_kX9To_M0UilI/preview) to evaluate and level-up your shipped products.
- You can help your peers debug their code.
